#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
num1 = int(input("Enter First number"))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second number"))
if num1 == num2:
    print("num1 is equal to num2")
if num1 > num2:
    print("num1 is greater than num2")
if num1 < num2:
    print("num1 is lesser than num2")
